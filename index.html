    <h1><a href="shortbio.HTML">Jade Pederson's Portfolio</a></h1>
    <p>In this web page, you will see a variety of geovisualization projects that I have worked on. These projects were done for the Introduction to Geographic Visualization class at the University of Iowa during the Spring of 2020.</p>
    <p>The projects were developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a number of visualization and mapping libraries tools such as CartoDB, Leaflet, and D3.</p>

This map represents the variability of population change between Canadian providences from 2011 to 2016. Only one province showed a negative population growth (or population decline) between 2011 and 2016. Therefore, it can be inferred that the country as a whole experienced population growth.

This map represents the relationship between per capita income and percentage of residents with an degree higher than an Associates for each Nebraska county. Like the previous map, there seems to be a trend where population is larger. In the case of this map, counties that house cities such as Lincoln and Omaha have a high per capita income and a high percentage of the population with an education beyond an associates degree.

              <p class="card-text">This project was done with three classmates. Since we were required to finish this class online due to health and safety concerns generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided that it would be interesting to do our final project on it. The purpose of the project was to highlight areas within the United States and within Iowa that are more vulnerable to the virus. Variables such as age, ethnicity, income levels, and location was examined. It was found that there are many populations who are vulnerable to this virus. Information from this report can be used to create protections for these populations to minimize their risk. </p>
